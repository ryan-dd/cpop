# Cpop

Do you ever get annoyed at parsing XML files? Do you just want a nice clean C++ struct that matches the XML structure of your config file? If so, this tiny library is for you. 

CPop (Config Populator) is a header only library that will populate your struct based on an xml file.

# Dependencies

Depends on header-only [__boost::pfr__](https://github.com/boostorg/pfr) for reflection like capabilities.
